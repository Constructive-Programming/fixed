# Fixed Type System

**Status:** Draft v0.4
**Specifies:** typing of Fixed v0.4 source.
**Last revised:** 2026-04-30

**Changes from v0.3.** Body introducer for fn/method definitions changed from `:` to `=` (block introducers `:` reserved for cap/data/effect/satisfies bodies and control-flow branches; definitions use `=`). Cap instance and static methods may carry default bodies (Rule 6.1). Lambda parameters gain optional types and defaults. EffectMember gains `WithClause?` and `TypeParamsHint?`. TupleExpr/TuplePattern simplified. Code examples updated.

**Changes from v0.2.** Code examples updated to the v0.3 indentation-based syntax (no block braces; `:` introduces blocks). No semantic rules changed.

**Changes from v0.1.** OQ1 resolved (multi-arg `Self of B`, Rule 5.4.b); OQ2 resolved (mutual data recursion, §7.5); OQ3 resolved (auto-derivation matrix, §7.4 expanded); OQ4 resolved (built-in representation candidates, §6.6); OQ5 resolved as deferred-to-v0.3 (§7.6); OQ6 resolved (type-alias `of`-distribution, §5.8); OQ7 pre-resolved and deferred to `spec/properties.md`.

## 1. Scope

This document defines the **typing rules** for Fixed: how the parser's untyped trees become typed trees, how capabilities and data types relate, how `of` application works, and how constructor calls resolve to concrete representations.

It does **not** define:

- QTT quantity inference (0/1/ω, erasure, linearity) — see `spec/quantities.md`.
- Effect-row inference and evidence-passing compilation — see `spec/effects.md`.
- `prop` static verification and PBT fallback — see `spec/properties.md`.
- `match → fold` desugaring and exhaustiveness checking — see `spec/pattern_matching.md`.
- Perceus reference-counting insertion — see `spec/perceus.md`.
- Capability-set narrowing into concrete representations (the algorithm) — touched in §4.5; full treatment lives with the compiler implementation, with PGO-driven decisions documented separately.

## 2. Dependencies

- `spec/syntax_grammar.ebnf` v0.2.3 — every syntactic form referenced here is defined there.
- `examples/01_basics.fixed` … `examples/11_properties.fixed` — every rule in this document is anchored to at least one example.

## 3. Two worlds: types and capabilities

Fixed makes a hard distinction between what the **programmer writes** and what the **compiler tracks internally**:

| Surface (programmer) | Internal (compiler) |
|---|---|
| **Capabilities** — what a value can *do* (`Sequencing`, `Numeric`, `Folding`) | **Types** — concrete representations the compiler chose |
| Capability bounds: `is Cap`, `N is Cap` | Type variables, type-class dictionaries |
| `data` declarations: closed sets of variants | Tagged unions / structs |
| `of` application | Type application |

A user never names "the type" in the conventional sense. The compiler computes a concrete representation from the union of capability bounds collected across a value's lifetime (see §4.5). For the rest of this document, "type" refers to the compiler's internal view; "capability" is the user-facing thing.

## 4. Identifier scoping

### 4.1 Type-variable introduction (resolves Q8)

**Rule 4.1.** An `UPPER_IDENT` in a type-binding position introduces a fresh type variable iff that name is not already bound in the enclosing scope. A **type-binding position** is any of:

- `IDENT is Bound` (named alias) — anywhere in a function signature, cap method signature, data variant field, or `of` argument list.
- `phantom IDENT` in an `of` argument list.
- A free occurrence of `UPPER_IDENT` that does not refer to a globally-declared cap, data, type, or effect.

Subsequent occurrences of the same `UPPER_IDENT` within the same signature **refer to the same type variable**. Intra-signature shadowing is a **compile error**.

**Scope.**

- For `fn`: the entire signature (parameters + return type + `with`-clause).
- For `cap` / `data` / `effect`: the entire body (including `extends` clauses).
- For nested `fn`: each inner function has its own scope; type variables introduced in the outer signature are still visible.

**Examples.**

```
// `examples/01_basics.fixed:30`  —  N introduced once, referenced twice
fn fib_iter(n: N is Numeric) -> N: ...
//          ^introduces      ^refers

// `examples/05_phantom_types.fixed:110-112`  —  U introduced once, referenced 3x
fn add(a: is Quantity of U, b: is Quantity of U) -> is Quantity of U: ...
//                       ^introduces, then 2 refs

// `examples/02_collections.fixed:127-129`  —  N introduced inside the `of`
fn sum(numbers: is Folding of (N is Numeric)) -> N: ...
```

**Non-example.** The following is rejected:

```
fn bad(x: N is Numeric) -> N =
    fn inner(x: N is Numeric) -> N: ...      // ERROR: N already in scope
```

### 4.2 Term-variable scoping

`let pat = expr` binds the names in `pat` for the rest of its enclosing block. There is no `let-in`; bindings flow through the block sequentially. A function parameter is in scope for the entire function body (and for nested `fn` definitions, since nested functions can capture).

## 5. Type expressions

The grammar of type expressions is defined in `spec/syntax_grammar.ebnf` §10. This section defines their meaning.

### 5.1 Capability bounds (`is`)

`is Cap` denotes "satisfies the capability `Cap`."

Two forms:

| Form | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `is Cap` | Anonymous bound: each occurrence in a signature is a *fresh* type variable. |
| `IDENT is Cap` | Named alias: every occurrence of `IDENT` in the signature refers to the *same* type variable, all of which must satisfy `Cap`. |

**Composition (§10 grammar `CapBoundChain`):** `is C1 + C2` means "satisfies both `C1` and `C2`." `+` is associative and commutative; `is C1 + C2` ≡ `is C2 + C1`.

```
fn count(c: is Folding) -> u64                          // anonymous: any Folding
fn fib_iter(n: N is Numeric) -> N                       // named: input and output share type
fn even_doubled(numbers: C is Filtering of (N is Numeric) + Functor of N) -> C
//              ^reused C    ^reused N as element type
```

### 5.2 `of` application

`Cap of A` applies `A` to `Cap`'s first type parameter. Multi-parameter caps use a tuple: `Cap of (A, B)`.

```
cap Sized of (Part, Size is Numeric)           // declares two params
fn size_of(c: is Sized of (i64, u64)) -> u64    // applies both
```

`of` arguments may be:

- Type expressions (`i64`, `String`, `Cap of A`, `N is Numeric`, …).
- `phantom IDENT` declarations (only at `of`-declaration sites).
- Value expressions when the corresponding parameter is a value-param (see §6.3 for data, §5.4 for `Self of B`).
- Literal values at type-application sites (so `Bounded of (i64, 5, 10)` parses).

### 5.3 The `Part` pseudo-parameter

Inside a `cap` body, the bare identifier `Part` refers to the cap's element-type parameter — the *first* parameter of the cap's `of` clause. If the cap declares no `of` clause, `Part` is the cap's single implicit element-type parameter.

```
cap Folding:                                   // no `of` — Part is the implicit element type
    fn fold(init: R, f: (R, Part) -> R) -> R

cap Sized of (Part, Size is Numeric):          // Part named explicitly in `of`
    fn size -> Size
```

**Rule 5.3.** For a `cap` declaration, `Part` resolves to the **first non-phantom type parameter** in the cap's `of` clause. If no such parameter exists, the cap is **`Part`-less**: using `Part` inside its body is a compile error.

### 5.4 `Self` and `Self of B`

Inside a `cap` body, `Self` refers to the type implementing this capability. Inside a `data` declaration, `Self` refers to the data type itself (with all its `of` arguments fixed). Inside a `satisfies` block, `Self` refers to the satisfying type.

`Self of B` denotes "the same container shape as `Self`, but with element type `B`" — used for higher-kinded returns:

```
cap Functor:
    fn map(f: Part -> B) -> Self of B          // B introduces a fresh type variable
```

**Rule 5.4.a (single-arg).** `Self of B` is well-formed only when `Self` has at least one non-phantom type parameter. The application substitutes `B` for `Self`'s **first non-phantom type parameter**; other parameters are preserved.

**Rule 5.4.b (multi-arg, resolves OQ1).** `Self of (B1, B2, ..., Bk)` substitutes `B1..Bk` positionally over the first `k` non-phantom type parameters of `Self`. The arity `k` must be at most the number of non-phantom parameters of `Self`; supplying more is a compile error.

```
cap BiFunctor of (A, B):
    fn bimap<A2, B2>(f: A -> A2, g: B -> B2) -> Self of (A2, B2)
```

### 5.5 Arrow types and the unit type

| Syntax | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `A -> B` | Function from `A` to `B` |
| `(A, B) -> C` | Function from a 2-tuple `(A, B)` to `C` (curried by the typer if the call site curries) |
| `() -> R` | Function from unit to `R` (zero-arg function) |
| `A -> B with E` | Arrow type carrying effect row `E` (defined in `spec/effects.md`) |
| `()` | The unit type. The unit value is also written `()`. Single-element type and value. |

### 5.6 The never type `!` and `unreachable` (resolves Q16)

`!` is the **never type** — the type of expressions that do not return. It is a **subtype of every type**: an expression of type `!` is valid wherever an expression of any other type is expected.

Two ways to obtain `!`:

- `unreachable` — keyword expression. Reaching it at runtime is a panic.
- A function returning `!` — by convention, an effect operation that does not return (e.g., `Fail.fail`).

```
// examples/03_option_result.fixed:56  —  `Fail.fail` returns `!`
effect Fail of E:
    fn fail(error: E) -> !

// examples/11_properties.fixed:138  —  `unreachable` used where `N` is expected
fn median(...) -> N =
    collection.get(mid).fold((v) -> v, () -> unreachable)
```

### 5.7 Numeric literal polymorphism (resolves Q10)

`INT_LITERAL` carries the polymorphic type `is Numeric`. `FLOAT_LITERAL` likewise (further constrainable to a floating-point sub-cap if/when the standard library declares one).

The typer resolves the concrete representation from context:

1. The expected type at the literal's position (function parameter, return position, assignment LHS, comparison operand).
2. Operand-unification: in `a + 1`, `1` resolves to whatever `a`'s type is.

If still unresolved, **defaults** apply:

- `INT_LITERAL → i64`
- `FLOAT_LITERAL → f64`

### 5.8 Type-alias `of`-distribution (resolves OQ6)

A type alias `type T = C1 + C2 + ... + Cn` is a bag of capabilities. When applied with `of` arguments, the application **distributes** over each constituent.

**Rule 5.8.** `is T of (X1, X2, ..., Xk)` where `type T = C1 + ... + Cn` is equivalent to:

- For each `Ci` that has at least one non-phantom type parameter: `Ci of (X1, ..., Xk)` (positional substitution per Rule 5.4.b, capped at `Ci`'s declared arity).
- For each `Ci` that has no type parameters: `Ci` unchanged.

```
type ArrayLike = Sequencing + RandomAccess + Sized + Empty

// `is ArrayLike of A` distributes to:
//   Sequencing of A + RandomAccess of A + Sized of A + Empty
// (Empty has no type parameters; passes through unchanged.)
```

If a constituent `Ci` declares more type parameters than the alias receives, the unspecified parameters remain **abstract** (fresh type variables introduced at the use site, scoped to the same signature).

`of`-distribution applies before `extends`-flattening: an alias's `of` arguments are propagated to its constituent caps before those caps' inherited members are inlined into the obligation set.

## 6. Capability declarations

### 6.1 Members

A `cap` declaration may contain three kinds of members (see grammar §4):

- **Instance methods** (`fn name(...) -> T`): called on a value satisfying the cap.
- **Static methods** (`Self.fn name(...) -> Self`): called on the cap or a satisfying type. Used to declare *constructor requirements*: any type satisfying the cap must provide these.
- **Properties** (`prop name: expr`): invariants the type must uphold (see `spec/properties.md`).

Instance and static methods may carry an optional body (v0.4):

```
cap Optional:
    Self.fn some(value: Part) -> Self
    Self.fn none -> Self
    fn fold<R>(on_some: Part -> R, on_none: () -> R) -> R

    // Default implementations — types satisfying Optional may override.
    fn isDefined -> bool = Self.fold((_) -> true, () -> false)
    fn or_else(default: Part) -> Part = Self.fold((v) -> v, () -> default)
```

**Rule 6.1 (Default method bodies / extension methods).** A cap method's optional body acts as both a *default implementation* — used when the satisfying type does not provide its own — and an *extension method*: every type satisfying the cap automatically gets the method as a callable, even without writing one in `satisfies`. Bodies may use `Self`, `Part`, and other in-scope cap members (including the cap's `Self.fn` constructors and abstract methods, which are guaranteed to be provided by the satisfying type).

### 6.2 `extends` inheritance

`cap A extends B + C` declares that any type satisfying `A` must also satisfy `B` and `C`. All members of `B` and `C` are inherited by `A`.

```
cap Optional extends Functor + Folding: ...    // examples/02_collections.fixed:60
```

**Rule 6.2 (Diamond resolution).** If `A` inherits the same member name from two different parents `B` and `C`, the inherited member's signatures must be compatible (one must be a subtype of the other under §7's subtyping). If they are not compatible, `A` must declare an explicit member of that name with a fresh signature.

### 6.3 Sugar: `cap Name(params)`

A capability with value parameters is sugar for a function returning a capability:

```
cap Between(min: N is Ord, max: N) of N:
    prop in_range: min <= Self && Self <= max

// is equivalent to

fn between(min: N is Ord, max: N) -> cap of N =
    prop in_range: min <= Self && Self <= max
```

Both forms produce a *cap-generating function* (see `spec/properties.md` for the prop semantics; this document treats `fn -> cap` as a regular function whose return type happens to be a refinement capability).

### 6.4 Capability classification

Every cap declaration is assigned exactly one **classification** based on its member shape. The classification drives representation selection (§4.5) and the legal operations on values bounded by the cap.

| Classification | Detection rule | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Sum** | At least one `Self.fn ctor(...) -> Self` plus one `fn fold<R>(...)` member | `Optional`, `Result`, `Expr` |
| **Product** | Exactly one `Self.fn ctor(...) -> Self`, plus accessor methods (`fn field -> T`) and no `fold` | `Config` (when expressed as a cap), `Message` |
| **Recursive** | Any `Self.fn` ctor whose parameter list contains `Self` | `Sequencing` (via `cons(h, t: Self) -> Self`) |
| **Capability-only** | No `Self.fn` constructors; only instance methods | `Folding`, `Functor`, `Filtering`, `Sized`, `RandomAccess` |
| **Marker** | No methods at all (possibly with `prop` declarations) | `Locked`, `Open`, `Meters`, `Seconds`; refinement caps `between(lo, hi)` |

A cap may belong to multiple of these categories transitively via `extends` (e.g., `Sequencing` is recursive *and* capability-only via the inherited members of `Folding`). The classification of the **declaring** cap is the union: the compiler treats it as "having sum/product/recursive shape" exactly when its own declared members trigger the rule.

**Note.** Refinement caps generated by `fn name(...) -> cap of T` are always **Marker** caps. They add `prop` obligations but no methods, and impose no representation constraints. A value `N is between(0, 100)` is still represented as `N`.

### 6.5 Representation selection (sketch)

Given the union of all capabilities a value must satisfy across its lifetime, the compiler picks the most specific viable concrete representation.

The algorithm narrows from a set of candidates:

1. Collect all `is`-bounds on the value.
2. For each in-scope `satisfies` declaration, check whether the providing data type can satisfy the entire bound set.
3. Built-in types (e.g., `i64`, contiguous arrays) are also candidates, governed by compiler-internal rules:
   - `is RandomAccess + Sized` → contiguous array preferred (linked list cannot satisfy `RandomAccess` efficiently).
   - `is Folding` only → any container, default to whatever PGO suggests.
   - `is Sequencing + Folding` without `RandomAccess` → linked list is acceptable; PGO may upgrade.
4. Ambiguity halts compilation with the suggestion list described in `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` §"Ambiguity resolution via compiler suggestions."

A normative algorithm and its complexity bounds will be specified separately when the representation-selection compiler pass is implemented.

### 6.6 Built-in representation candidates (resolves OQ4)

The compiler maintains a set of **built-in representation candidates** — concrete types known to the compiler that satisfy specific capability combinations without any user-written `satisfies` declaration. These are part of the candidate pool during representation selection (§6.5).

The illustrative set for v0.2:

| Built-in representation | Satisfies (when type parameters are filled) |
|---|---|
| Linked list of `T` | `Sequencing of T + Folding of T + Empty + Filtering + Functor` |
| Contiguous array of `T` | `Sequencing of T + Folding of T + RandomAccess of (T, u64) + Sized of (T, u64) + Empty + Filtering + Functor` |
| Hash map of `K × V` | `Map of (K, V)` (when `K` satisfies `Hash + Eq`) |
| Auto-tagged-union for a sum cap | The sum cap's full method set (auto-implemented from the cap's `Self.fn` constructors) |
| Auto-flat-struct for a product cap | The product cap's full method set |

**Rule 6.6 (priority).** During representation selection, built-in candidates have **equal priority** to user-`satisfies`-mapped data types. If a user-defined data type can satisfy the same bound set, it competes alongside the built-in candidates; the compiler picks among them by **allocation and performance heuristics**, with PGO refinement when profile data is available.

The full list of built-ins is implementation-defined and may grow with the compiler's capability-recognition library; the table above is normative only for the categories listed.

## 7. Data declarations

### 7.1 Variants and fields

A `data` declaration introduces a closed set of named variants. Two forms (grammar §6):

```
data Direction:                              // unit variants (indented form)
    North
    South
    East
    West

data Color:                                  // mixed variants
    Red
    Green
    Blue
    RGB(red: N is Numeric, green: N, blue: N)

data Config(host: String, port: u16, debug: bool)              // single-ctor sugar (paren form)
```

Fields may have **default values**:

```
data Bounded of (N is Numeric + Ord, lo: N = 16, hi: N = 24):
    Bounded(value: N)
    // ...
```

A variant constructor call passes arguments **positionally**, with trailing arguments using their declared defaults if omitted.

### 7.2 Recursive data

A `data` declaration is recursive iff at least one variant has a field whose type mentions the data type itself (transitively). Recursive data is heap-allocated by default (see `spec/perceus.md`).

```
data Tree of A:
    Leaf(value: A)
    Branch(left: Tree of A, value: A, right: Tree of A)
    Empty
```

### 7.3 `of` value-params at the type level (resolves N1)

Non-`phantom` `of` parameters with a type annotation (e.g., `lo: N = 16`) are **type-level indices**: different supplied values produce **distinct types**.

```
data Bounded of (N is Numeric + Ord, lo: N = 16, hi: N = 24):
    Bounded(value: N)
    prop in_range: forall (b: Self) -> b.lo <= b.value && b.value <= b.hi

// Two distinct types — values are not assignable across them:
//   Bounded of (i64, 0, 10)
//   Bounded of (i64, 5, 100)
```

**Rule 7.3.a (Defaults at type-application sites).** Missing trailing args at a type-application site take their declared defaults; positional only.

```
Bounded of N                ≡  Bounded of (N, 16, 24)       // both defaults
Bounded of (N, 5)           ≡  Bounded of (N, 5, 24)        // hi default
Bounded of (N, 5, 30)       — exact application
Bounded of (N, , 30)        — INVALID: no positional skip in v0.2
Bounded of (N, hi=30)       — INVALID: no named application in v0.2
```

Omitting an arg with no declared default is a compile error.

**Rule 7.3.b (QTT for of value-params).** Non-phantom `of` value-params are quantity 0 by default — type-level, erased at runtime. The compiler materialises them as compile-time constants at access sites (so `b.lo` in `b.lo <= b.value` becomes the statically known constant for `b`'s type). See `spec/quantities.md` for the full rule.

**Rule 7.3.c (Constructor calls).** A variant constructor call passes only the variant's **declared fields** positionally. The values of the data type's `of` value-params come from the type at which the variant is being constructed:

```
let x: Bounded of (i64, 0, 10) = Bounded.Bounded(5)
//                                ^value=5, lo=0, hi=10 from type
```

### 7.4 Auto-derived capabilities (resolves OQ3)

A `data` declaration automatically satisfies certain capabilities based on its variant shape and field types. Auto-derivation requires no `satisfies` declaration; the compiler synthesises the implementation.

**Rule 7.4.a (Folding).** Every `data` declaration with at least one variant gets an auto-derived `fold<R>` method. The fold takes one callback per variant, in declaration order, with parameter list mirroring the variant's field list. Recursive `Self`-typed fields are pre-folded to `R` before the callback runs.

```
data Expr:
    Lit(value: f64)
    Add(left: Expr, right: Expr)
    Mul(left: Expr, right: Expr)
    Neg(inner: Expr)

// Auto-derived:
//   fn fold<R>(
//       on_lit: f64 -> R,
//       on_add: (R, R) -> R,
//       on_mul: (R, R) -> R,
//       on_neg: R -> R,
//   ) -> R
```

Auto-derived `fold` is the canonical eliminator and the destructuring path for any `is`-bounded view of the data. `match` works directly on `data` values too (per `spec/pattern_matching.md`); `fold` is what the typer emits for capability-bounded views.

**Rule 7.4.b (Unfolding).** A recursive `data` declaration (any variant has at least one field of type `Self`, transitively) gets an auto-derived `unfold<S>` method (anamorphism). Given a seed `s: S` and a step function returning one variant of `Self` with seeds in recursive positions, `unfold` builds the structure:

```
fn unfold<S>(seed: S, step: S -> Self) -> Self
```

The compiler iterates `step` until no recursive seeds remain. The combination of `fold` (Rule 7.4.a) and `unfold` enables hylomorphism (`unfold` then `fold`) and the compiler is permitted to fuse the intermediate structure away.

**Rule 7.4.c (Functor over the rightmost type parameter).** A `data T of (X1, ..., Xn)` declaration is auto-derived as `Functor of Xn` (the **rightmost type parameter** — right-bias convention) iff:

1. `Xn` is non-phantom and is a type parameter (not a value parameter).
2. `Xn` appears in **covariant** position in at least one variant field.
3. `Xn` does **not** appear in contravariant position (e.g., as a function-parameter type) in any variant field.

The auto-derived `map` is implemented as a `fold` that re-builds each variant with the function applied to fields of type `Xn`, leaving fields of other types untouched. The map's range type substitutes `Xn` with the supplied target type:

```
data Maybe of A:
    Just(value: A)
    Nothing
// Auto-derived:
//   fn map<B>(f: A -> B) -> Maybe of B   (= Self of B)
```

**Rule 7.4.d (Accessors for product-shaped data).** A single-variant `data T(field1: T1, ..., fieldn: Tn)` (or equivalently `data T:` followed by an indented `T(field1: T1, ..., fieldn: Tn)` variant) automatically gets accessor methods:

```
fn field1 -> T1
fn field2 -> T2
...
```

These accessors are auto-implemented and require no `satisfies` declaration.

**Rule 7.4.e (Marker / refinement caps are never auto-derived).** Marker caps (no methods) and refinement caps generated by `fn -> cap` impose `prop` obligations only; they are never auto-derived. Satisfaction is by static verification (see `spec/properties.md`), not by code synthesis.

**Rule 7.4.f (Caps with `Self.fn` constructors require explicit `satisfies`).** A cap declaring any `Self.fn` constructor (sum or product classification, §6.4) is **never** auto-derived. An explicit `satisfies` mapping is required to bind data variants to cap constructors:

```
data Maybe of A:
    Just(value: A)
    Nothing
// `Functor of A` is auto-derived (Rule 7.4.c).
// `Optional` requires an explicit mapping because it declares Self.fn some / Self.fn none:
Maybe satisfies Optional:
    Just as some
    Nothing as none
```

**Right-bias and ambiguity.** When right-bias does not uniquely determine the active type parameter (e.g., a cap declares no preferred parameter, or the data type has equally-positioned candidates), the compiler halts with the standard ambiguity error and copy-pasteable disambiguation suggestions per `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` §"Right-bias and ambiguity resolution."

### 7.5 Mutual recursion across data declarations (resolves OQ2)

Two or more `data` declarations may recursively reference each other:

```
data Tree:
    Branch(node: Node)
    Leaf

data Node:
    N(tree: Tree, value: i64)
```

**Rule 7.5.** Mutual recursion across `data` declarations is supported. The Namer pass enters all data symbols with lazy completers; the Typer pass forces them as needed, breaking cycles via fixed-point iteration on the data dependency graph (the same mechanism used for mutual `cap` declarations).

Representation: data types in a strongly-connected component of the data dependency graph are co-allocated. The compiler treats them as a single recursive group requiring heap allocation; refcount headers are shared per-node, and the compiler may emit a unified tag space across the group when this enables better packing. See `spec/perceus.md` for refcount details.

Self-recursion (a single data type referencing itself) is the trivial 1-element SCC and is handled by the same rule.

### 7.6 GADT-style equality constraints (deferred to v0.3, resolves OQ5)

Fixed v0.2 `data` declarations are **strictly parametric**: every variant of a `data T of (params)` declaration produces values of the same `T of (params)` instantiation.

If a variant field's type uses a non-parametric `of` argument (e.g., a `data Expr of A:` declaration whose `Add` variant is `Add(left: Expr of i64, right: Expr of i64)`), the field's type is interpreted **literally** — the variant constructs `Expr of A` containing an `Expr of i64` child, regardless of `A`. The typer does **not** narrow `A` to `i64` when matching the `Add` variant.

Per-variant type narrowing in pattern arms (the GADT feature in Haskell, OCaml, and similar languages) is queued for v0.3. When introduced, it will require explicit syntax distinguishing parametric from existentially-narrowed parameters (proposed direction: `data Expr where { LitInt :: Int -> Expr Int; ... }`-style or equivalent Fixed-flavoured syntax).

## 8. `satisfies`

### 8.1 Mapping form

```
data Maybe of A:
    Just(value: A)
    Nothing

Maybe satisfies Optional:
    Just as some
    Nothing as none
```

**Rule 8.1.a (Variant-to-constructor).** Each `Variant as ctor` line maps a data variant to one of the cap's `Self.fn` constructors. The variant's field types must match (or be a refinement of) the corresponding `Self.fn`'s parameter types.

**Rule 8.1.b (Coverage).** A complete `satisfies` declaration must map every `Self.fn` constructor of the cap to either a data variant or `impossible`:

```
NonEmptyList satisfies Sequencing:
    Cons as cons
    impossible as empty       // NonEmptyList has no empty case
```

### 8.2 `impossible`

Mapping `impossible as ctor` declares that the cap's constructor `ctor` is unreachable for this satisfying type. Any code path that reaches `Cap.ctor(...)` on a value statically known to be of this satisfying type is a compile error.

```
u64 satisfies Optional of Self:
    Self as some                 // u64 is its own Just
    impossible as none           // u64 is never absent
// Optional.none on a u64 is a compile error
```

**Rule 8.2.** The compiler verifies `impossible` soundness: no branch of a reachable expression may construct the marked constructor on a value statically constrained to be of this satisfying type.

### 8.3 Method-body form

A `satisfies` block may also provide explicit method definitions:

```
Maybe satisfies Optional:
    fn isDefined = match Self:
        Maybe.Nothing => false
        Maybe.Just(_) => true
    ...
```

This is required when the auto-derivation rules (§7.4) cannot uniquely produce the cap's required methods (e.g., when multiple right-bias choices are available; see `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` §"Right-bias and ambiguity").

### 8.4 Modular import

A `satisfies` declaration is **modular**: it must be brought into scope at use sites via `use`:

```
use std.maybe.Maybe satisfies Optional
```

This single declaration imports both `Maybe` (the type) and the satisfaction binding it to `Optional`. Without the `satisfies` clause, only the type is imported; satisfaction is invisible.

There is **no global coherence requirement**. Different modules can map the same data type to different capabilities, or even map the same `Cap.ctor` differently — as long as no single use site has more than one resolution in scope (otherwise §8.5 ambiguity applies).

### 8.5 Constructor resolution

A call `Cap.ctor(args...)` resolves to a concrete data constructor as follows:

1. Collect the in-scope `satisfies` declarations for `Cap`.
2. Filter by **expected type** at the call site:
   - Function return type: `fn f(...) -> is Optional of A: Optional.some(x)` — the call resolves against types that satisfy `Optional of A`.
   - Assignment LHS type: `let y: is Optional of u64 = Optional.some(42)`.
   - Argument expected type at a function call.
3. If exactly one satisfying type matches, resolution succeeds.
4. If zero match, the call is a type error.
5. If multiple match, the typer halts with an ambiguity error and emits copy-pasteable disambiguation suggestions per `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` §"Ambiguity resolution via compiler suggestions."

Direct data construction (`Maybe.Just(42)`) bypasses resolution: it always produces a value of the named data type, regardless of which caps are in scope.

## 9. Effects (brief)

`effect E: fn op(...) -> T` declares a set of effect operations. A function that performs effects declares them in its `with` clause: `fn read() -> String with FileSystem`. Effect rows compose with `+`. This document does not specify effect inference, evidence-passing compilation, or handler semantics; see `spec/effects.md`.

For typing purposes here, an effect's operations are first-class methods on the effect type (e.g., `Console.print_line(s)` is a method call returning `()` and adding `Console` to the caller's effect row).

## 10. Type inference architecture

The typer is **bidirectional** with **prototype types** carried as expected-type arguments. The high-level shape is documented in `docs/references/scala3-compiler-reference.md` §4.3; this section records Fixed-specific decisions.

### 10.1 Two passes

1. **Index pass (Namer).** Walk all top-level declarations; create symbols for `cap`, `data`, `effect`, `type`, `fn`, and `satisfies` declarations with **lazy completers** for their bodies. This enables mutual recursion across declarations: a `cap A extends B` and `cap B extends A` (if both type-checkable) can refer to each other before either body is fully processed.
2. **Type pass (Typer).** Type each function body, forcing the lazy completers as needed.

### 10.2 Bidirectional checking

Every typed expression carries an **expected type (prototype)** flowing from the surrounding context. The typer's main entry is roughly:

```
typed(expr, pt) → typed expression of type T such that T <: pt
```

Where `<:` is subtyping (§10.4). Prototypes may be:

- A concrete type (`u64`, `is Optional of A`, …)
- A function-application prototype (`FunProto`): "I am being called with these arguments."
- A selection prototype (`SelectionProto`): "I expect a member named `foo` here."
- The wildcard `?` (no expectation; pure type synthesis).

### 10.3 `is`-bound flow

When typing an expression `e` against an expected type that includes a capability bound `is C`, the typer:

1. Synthesizes `e`'s natural type `T`.
2. Verifies that some satisfaction binds `T` to `C` (directly, transitively via `extends`, or via auto-derivation §7.4).
3. Records the satisfaction so subsequent method calls on `e` can resolve to `C`'s methods.

### 10.4 Subtyping

Subtyping in Fixed is intentionally narrow:

- **`!` is a subtype of every type.** Expressions of type `!` are valid in any expression position.
- **A type satisfying a cap is a subtype of that cap-bound.** `Maybe of i64` is a subtype of `is Optional of i64` (assuming the satisfaction is in scope).
- **Capability bounds compose by intersection.** `is C1 + C2` is a subtype of `is C1` and of `is C2`.
- **Refinement caps strengthen, not weaken.** `N is Numeric + between(0, 100)` is a subtype of `N is Numeric`.
- **No structural subtyping on `data`.** Two `data` declarations with identical structure are distinct types.

## 11. Open questions

(All OQ1–OQ6 from v0.1 are resolved in this version; their resolutions are folded into the relevant sections above. OQ7 is pre-resolved and deferred to `spec/properties.md`.)

**Pre-resolved deferrals (lift into the indicated spec doc when drafted):**

- **OQ7 → spec/properties.md.** In a function-body postcondition `prop` (i.e., a `prop` declaration appearing inside a `fn` block, not inside a `cap` or `data` body), the identifier `result` is **implicitly bound** to the function's return value at the function's declared return type. The binding is in scope only inside that prop body. In other prop contexts (cap-member or data-member props), `result` carries no special meaning and is parsed as a regular identifier.

  ```
  fn sort(collection: ...) -> C is Sorted =
      prop result_same_size: result.size == collection.size
      //                     ^^^^^^ implicitly bound to the fn's return value
      collection.fold_right(...)
  ```

**Carried over from `docs/plans/implementation-plan.md` (Open Design Questions, not resolved here):**

- Effect handler composition syntax (plan ODQ #6). Defer to `spec/effects.md`.
- FFI boundary semantics (plan ODQ #5). Out of scope for the type system spec.
- Codata as a third declaration form alongside `data` and `cap` (plan ODQ #12). Defer to a future spec doc.
- Error-message wording rules (plan ODQ #4). Implementation-side, not normative for typing.
